<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, a little bit about me. I live in the great state of Texas. I have two sons, three kitties and an elderly cattle dog. We are all just trying to get through this thing called life.</p>

<p>I started out many many eons ago building web pages and then got away from it. I have now decided to come back and see if I enjoy building sites like I once did. So far I am enjoying it very much and hope to make a living at doing this.</p>

<p>I look forward to advancing my knowledge of web building and being able to create dynamic and stunning websistes for people and businesses. If you are interested in talking to me about your project please <a href="./contact.html">reach out!</a></p>
